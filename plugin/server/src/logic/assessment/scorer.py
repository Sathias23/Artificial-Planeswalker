"""The pure ``score()`` entry point composing the assessment core (AD-2).

The composition contract everyone already wrote down (``aggregate.py``): ``score()``
runs :func:`~src.logic.assessment.combos.match_combos` →
:func:`~src.logic.assessment.dimensions.dimension_vector` /
:func:`~src.logic.assessment.dimensions.bracket_floor` →
:func:`~src.logic.assessment.aggregate.aggregate_score` +
:func:`~src.logic.assessment.aggregate.tier_label`, exactly once each, and packages the
results as the frozen :class:`CoreAssessment`. Pure and deterministic (AD-2): no
network, DB, clock, randomness, or logging — identical ``(deck_cards, commanders,
variants, profile)`` input yields an equal ``CoreAssessment``.

**The rubric fork lives in what is COMPOSED, never inside any module:** under a
``heuristic_only`` profile the composer never calls ``bracket_floor()`` at all —
``bracket_floor=None`` / ``cedh_candidate=False`` — and the edge emits ``bracket:
null`` (AD-7 fixed shape). No scoring math branches on ``rubric``.

**Trigger semantics:** ``mass_land_denial`` (any tagged card present)
and ``extra_turn_chains`` (quantity-aware ``EXTRA_TURN`` count at or above
:data:`~src.logic.assessment.dimensions.EXTRA_TURN_CHAIN_MIN` — the same rule
``bracket_floor`` gates on) are computed format-agnostically for BOTH rubrics from one
:func:`~src.logic.assessment.classifiers.classify_deck` read. A Standard deck running
Armageddon factually HAS mass land denial — the flag is explainability, not a bracket
verdict; ``bracket_floor=None`` is what says "no bracket". Commander parity with
``BracketFloorSignal.mass_land_denial`` / ``.extra_turn_chain`` is pinned by test.

**Honest internal re-derivations:** the composed public functions
re-derive shared signals internally — ``dimension_vector`` and ``bracket_floor`` each
run their own ``classify_deck``/``compute_curve``, and ``bracket_floor`` re-derives its
own :class:`~src.logic.assessment.dimensions.GameChangerSignal` — so ``score()`` makes
no single-classification claim. The deck is scanned more than once per call: cheap and
correctness-neutral.

**Edge consumer map:** the assess tool passes snapshot variants + resolved
commanders in and maps ``game_changers.unknown_count > 0`` →
``game_changer_data_unavailable``; the serializer turns ``CoreAssessment`` into
``AssessDeckPowerResult`` (``bracket_floor=None`` → ``bracket: null``,
``game_changers.card_names`` → ``flags.game_changers``); the compare tool diffs two of
these — the field names here are its delta keys. No confidence level, ``reasons[]``,
summary, ``data_vintage``, or serialization here — edge policy (AD-6/AD-7/AD-8).

    """The fixed-shape result of one ``score()`` call (AD-7 discipline starts here).

    Every field is always present for any format — Standard holds
    ``bracket_floor=None`` plus ``False`` Bracket booleans, never a missing key. All
    collection fields are tuples that arrive pre-sorted from their producers
    (``combos`` by ``spellbook_id``, ``structural_gaps`` and
    ``game_changers.card_names`` bytewise) — nothing is re-sorted here.

    Attributes:
        vector: The FR16 7-dimension integer vector — all seven dimensions, any format.
        for_format_score: The FR19 0-100 for-format aggregate (no 1-10 scale anywhere).
        tier: The FR24 descriptive tier label — never a bare number.
        bracket_floor: The FR18 computed Bracket floor (``{2, 3, 4}``) under
            ``rubric == "brackets"``; ``None`` under ``heuristic_only`` (the composer
            never calls ``bracket_floor()`` on that path).
        cedh_candidate: The FR18 candidacy flag under ``brackets`` — candidacy only,
            never an asserted Bracket 5; ``False`` under ``heuristic_only``.
        game_changers: The AD-4 three-state Game Changer read, computed for BOTH
            rubrics: ``card_names`` feeds the edge's ``flags.game_changers``,
            ``unknown_count`` is the edge's ``game_changer_data_unavailable`` input —
            the core emits the VALUE, never the confidence token or level.
        combos: The matched records (buckets set, sorted by ``spellbook_id``, exactly
            as ``match_combos`` returns them).
        structural_gaps: The FR9 closed gap tokens under the profile's Karsten
            formula, bytewise-sorted.
        mass_land_denial: Whether any mass-land-denial card is present — one
            semantic for both formats (see the module docstring).
        extra_turn_chains: Whether the quantity-aware extra-turn count reaches the
            chain threshold — the same rule ``bracket_floor`` gates on, computed for
            both formats.
