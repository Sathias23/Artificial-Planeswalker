"""FR13/FR15 pure combo matching, bracket mapping & derived values (Story 5.6).

The combo seam of the deck-power feature (AD-11): the deterministic matcher that
assigns each Spellbook variant its ``included``/``almost_included`` bucket (FR13 —
matching is pure core per AD-9; Epic 6 only delivers the data), the closed
``BRACKET_TAG_TO_BRACKET`` map, and the derived-not-stored helpers (``combo_type``,
``earliest_turn_estimate``) that feed Story 5.7's two-card-infinite Bracket trigger and
``combo_potential`` dimension. Raw signals only: no 0–100 mapping, no Bracket floor, no
confidence tokens, no serialization — those belong to 5.7/5.8/Epic 7. The record shape
itself is :class:`~src.data.schemas.combo.ComboRecord` at the schema layer (see its
module docstring for the AD-11 placement rationale); this module owns the semantics.

Everything here is a pure function over already-loaded Pydantic schemas — no network,
DB, clock, file I/O, or randomness (AD-2). Commanders arrive as an already-resolved
name list (AD-13): the core never resolves or queries for them. Outputs are
deterministically ordered (sorted by ``spellbook_id``) so identical input always yields
identical output (AD-8 spirit).

Relationship to :data:`~src.logic.assessment.classifiers.WINCON_COMBO_PIECE`: that tag
is an independent text-level *pre-signal* (oracle-text heuristics). This module's
Spellbook-backed matching supersedes it for combo purposes but does not touch it — the
two must never be conflated, which is why this module deliberately imports no sibling
assessment module.

Decide-once policies (documented at each code site): lowercased name comparison with
DFC front-face indexing; quantity-aware shortfall buckets; the commander requirement as
an availability-neutral zone gate; sideboard rows NOT filtered (the standing
5.3/5.4/5.5 policy — deck composition belongs to the caller; Epic 7 passes
mainboard-only rows); ``"infinite"``-substring type detection; and the naive
one-land-per-turn earliest-turn model. The type tokens and turn heuristic are
provisional v1 values — Story 5.9's benchmark pass owns tuning them.

    The naive one-land-per-turn model (implementation-owned per the spine's "Deferred";

    on turn ``T`` is ``T`` and cumulative mana is ``T*(T+1)/2``. The estimate is the
    smallest ``T`` with ``T >= ceil(max piece mana value)`` (you must be able to cast
    the biggest piece) and ``T*(T+1)/2 >= ceil(total piece mana value)`` (you must have
    paid for all pieces). Worked examples: pieces (2, 2) → total 4, max 2 → T=3 (T=2:
    3 < 4); pieces (1, 1) → T=2 (T=1: 1 < 2); pieces (6,) → T=6; no pieces → 1 (floor).
    Ramp/tutor acceleration is deliberately ignored — 5.7 combines this with ramp
    density for ``speed``; modeling it here would double-count acceleration.

    documented optimistic undercount; a combo with zero resolvable pieces returns ``1``
    (the floor), never raises. ``cmc`` floats are ``ceil``-ed before comparison, so the
    result is pure integer arithmetic — deterministic, always ``int >= 1``. Sideboard
