"""FastMCP server builder for Artificial-Planeswalker (Story 1.3; sync RAG tools added 2.4/2.5).

Constructs the ``FastMCP`` server and registers the tool surface. The Epic-1 tools are
``async def`` and ``await`` the async ``src/data`` repositories directly on the
FastMCP event loop (D-1.3a), closing over a ``session_factory`` so the server is
test-injectable; the default factory reuses the data-layer engine.

The Epic-2 search tools are fundamentally different: they are **sync** ``def`` tools (FastMCP runs
them in its anyio worker threadpool) because the vector index is reachable only on the sync
``sqlite-vec`` ``ConnectionFactory`` connection — the async aiosqlite engine never loads the
extension. ``semantic_search_cards`` (Story 2.4) embeds a natural-language query, so it also closes
over an optional ``embedder`` (a test seam; the production embedder is resolved lazily inside the
tool via :func:`get_embedder`, never at build time). ``find_similar_cards`` (Story 2.5) is seeded by
a card's **stored** vector and **never embeds**, so it uses only the ``connection_factory`` seam —
no embedder. Both close over the injected ``connection_factory`` (per-thread sqlite-vec connection,
NFR6).

Two first-run tools sit alongside these: ``initialize_database`` (async — the one-time in-client
Scryfall card import that build-on-first-run depends on, since a packaged install ships no data) and
``build_search_index`` (sync — builds the ``card_vec`` index). Every card/deck tool guards an
un-imported database with a graceful ``database_not_initialized`` status that points at
``initialize_database`` rather than leaking a raw "no such table" error.

The read-only ``view_deck`` tool renders a saved deck to a self-contained HTML page and
best-effort opens it in the host's default browser (a local-bundle side effect; the file
path is always returned, so a headless host degrades gracefully).

Registration is transport-agnostic: the transport string is selected only at the
entry point (``src/mcp_server/__main__.py``), never here (AC2 / D7).
